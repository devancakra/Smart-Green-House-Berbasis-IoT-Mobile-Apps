# Smart-Green-House-Berbasis-IoT-Mobile-Apps
<strong>Edspert.id Final Project: Intensive Bootcamp Internet of Things Batch-10</strong><br><br>
Green House is a building for plant cultivation that has a translucent roof and wall structure. Farmers are helped by the existence of this Green House, but it still requires certain conditioning in order to achieve what is desired. This is usually done traditionally, so it is considered less effective, especially in an era full of sophisticated technology like today. In addition, theft and building break-ins are topics that need attention in addition to vegetable maintenance. This project was created to help farmers to manage their Green House quickly and precisely both in close and long distances. This project has been carried out and took approximately 1 month. The system can monitor air temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, pump status, door status, and security alarms. In addition, this system has also been provided with automatic pump control and automatic door lock features, so that this can increase efficiency in maintaining vegetables and security in the Green House area. This system is based on the Internet of Things (IoT), using HTTP as the communication protocol. The system interface uses the MIT App Inventor application.

      • Wait until the message appears: ``` Done Uploading ``` -> ``` The program is directly operated ```.

      • Press the ``` EN (RST) ``` button and then ``` Restart ``` to handle the ``` ESP32 ``` board that cannot process the ``` SC ```.

      • Do not press the ``` BOOT ``` and ``` EN ``` buttons at the same time as this may switch to ``` Upload Firmware ``` mode.

    </td></tr></table><br>

11. As for program upload, the ``` NodeMCU board ``` is superior because it can generally be done automatically.<br><br>

12. If there is still a problem when uploading the program, then try checking the ``` driver ``` / ``` port ``` / ``` others ``` section.

<br><br>
